#   About me!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Teresa, a young aspiring programmer who recently transitioned from the translation industry to the world of coding. This shift has been a thrilling journey for me, allowing me to explore and cultivate new skills while pursuing my passion for technology.


#  Background

For the past two and a half years, I've been immersed in the translation field, where English became my primary working language. This experience not only honed my linguistic abilities but also exposed me to diverse cultural contexts and communication styles. As a result, I've developed a strong command of English, both spoken and written, which I leverage in my current pursuits within the programming community.

#  Skills

## Language Proficiency

-   Fluent in English (spoken and written)
- Beginner in German

##  Project Management
Prior experience in project coordination and management, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and deadlines are met.

## Self-Directed Learning

Proven track record of self-teaching and acquiring new knowledge independently. I thrive in environments that encourage continuous learning and personal growth.

##  Passion for Programming

My transition to programming has been fueled by a deep-seated passion for technology and innovation. I've discovered a newfound excitement in solving problems, building applications, and creating solutions that have a real-world impact. Every line of code I write is a step closer to unlocking the endless possibilities of software development.


#  What's Next?


I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of programming, learning new languages, frameworks, and best practices along the way. Whether it's building web applications, exploring data science, or delving into machine learning, I'm excited to tackle new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects.
